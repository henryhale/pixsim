## Overview

The details of the entire simulation as well as the implementation of each
component are described in this documentation.

It begins with the virtualization of a display unit like a monitor/screen
containing a grid of pixels. Then we design an assembly-like language (including
syntax & semantics, mnemonics, instruction format) to enable us manipulate those
pixels easily, say a single pixel or group of pixels in a specific area. Based
on the assembly language, the instruction set architecture(ISA) is designed to
specify which instructions will be supported, how operands will be formatted,
and how control flow will be managed. Finally, the display unit's chip, that
will execute each instruction in the ISA, is designed and tested using test
programs written in our assembly-like language.

> [!NOTE] Each component of this simulation uses web technologies: HTML, CSS,
> JavaScript/TypeScript and primarily designed for desktop use. This allows for
> easy and quick access for everyone on any platform using a web browser. It
> implies that some limitations(like performance) of the simulation are tightly
> bounded by browser's abilities.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to illustrate how monitors/screens work by
simulating their display mechanism, chip, and logic.

Specifically, the objectives for this simulation are;

To implement

1. [x] [Display Unit](./display-unit.md) - A grid of tiny monochromatic pixels
       (say black and white) - bitmap
2. [x] [Custom Assembly-like Language](./language.md) for graphics or pixel
       manipulation like drawing lines, shapes, and more
    - [x] [Instruction Set](./isa.md) - a standard for which the display unit
          operates and communicates
    - [x] [Virtual Chip](./virtual-chip.md) - to simulate a cpu that sends video
          signals to the display unit
3. [x] [Character Encoding](./character-encoding.md) - characters for our
       display unit
4. [x] [Font Editor](./font-editor.md) - create a font containing all every
       character in the character set
5. [x] [Image Generator](./image-generator.md) - convert the underlying bitmap
       into an pixelated image The scope of this project lies in simulating how
       the monitor/screen works. More technical details about logic circuits,
       display chip or wiring are not included.
6. [x] [Character Rendering](./text-rendering.md) - transform binary data into
       pixel data and then render/draw characters

## Background

In this section, a description of the relationship of all the components
involved is discussed.

Suppose that you are typing a command in your terminal/notepad. Every time you
press a key this is what happens behind the scenes;

1. **key detection**: the keyboard registers the physical action and generates a
   unique electrical signal corresponding to that key.
2. **key scan**: the keyboard's microcontroller scans the key matrix to identify
   which key has been pressed, converting it into a keycode.
3. **hardware interrupt**: the keyboard sends an interrupt signal to the
   processor (CPU). This interrupt alerts the CPU that new input is available.
4. **interrupt handling**: the CPU temporarily halts its current operations and
   jumps to the interrupt handler, a specific routine designed to manage
   keyboard input.
5. **reading keycode**: the interrupt handler reads the keycode from the
   keyboard's buffer. Each key corresponds to a unique binary number (scan
   code).
6. **character translation**: the operating system (OS) takes the keycode and
   translates it into a character using the current character set (e.g. ASCII,
   UTF-8).
    - for example, pressing the 'A' key might correspond to the keycode that
      translates to the binary number `01000001` in ASCII.
7. **accumulator(data register)**: the OS stores the translated binary
   representation of the character in the accumulator, preparing it to be sent
   to the appropriate program (your terminal/notepad in this case).
8. **interrupt return**: The OS then forwards the character to the application
   (your terminal). This often involves a system call where the OS communicates
   with the terminal application.
9. **reading the input character**: The terminal application receives the
   character from the OS. It retrieves the character from the accumulator and
   processes it, which may involve updating the display buffer.
10. **displaying the character**: the terminal application updates the screen by
    rendering the character in the appropriate font and position based on the
    current cursor location. This might involve converting to pixel data for
    rendering.
11. **refreshing the display**: the display is refreshed to show the new
    character. The terminal may redraw the entire screen or just the part that
    changed, depending on its implementation.

This entire process occurs in a matter of milliseconds, making it feel
instantaneous to you. Each step involves intricate communication between the
keyboard, CPU, OS, and application, ensuring that your input is accurately
captured and displayed.
